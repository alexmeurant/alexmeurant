## Hi there 👋

Finance professional and entrepreneur passionate about tech, I have coded my way with versatility and adaptability.

In 2023, I had the desire (a little crazy? 🤪) to embark on a professional reorientation and not just any... The tech world and particularly IT development.

After 1 month of intense and exceptional experience during the « piscine », I'm starting the Common Core of [42 Nice](https://42nice.fr/) 👨🏻‍💻 🚀
